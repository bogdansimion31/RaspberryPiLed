Project description

I have attached an LED band to a breadboard connected to a RaspberryPi. I used a python script to turn on the led band, each led at a time.
Also, I have created an android companion app that opens/closes the led through http communication with the RaspberryPi.

Schematics, Setup and build

I have attached a mouse, keyboard and monitor to the RaspberryPi in order to program it. From the RaspberryPi I have connected one jumping
wire to power the breadboard (red). Next to it is our resistor, then 10 jumping wires ( red & orange) to power the led band. Then I connected 
the led band and next to it 10 more jumping wires ( multicolor: blue, white, purple, yellow, green) that control GPIO.
After I had finished the hardware setup, I wrote the python script to power the led band, each led at a time. Then I setup the RaspberryPi as a
server so that we can communicate with the android app through http get/post. I then wrote the android app using a simple interface with one 
button that serves both as power on and off. The app sends a request on button click that lets the RaspberryPi know itâ€™s time to power the led.

Running

Once the hardware is connected, we have to power up the server on the RaspberryPi, then the android app and we are set to go.
